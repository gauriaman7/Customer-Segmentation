About

This project performs customer segmentation using machine learning algorithms like K-Means clustering. It segments customers based on their behavioral data to help businesses tailor marketing strategies and improve customer engagement and retention.

Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries/Tools:

Jupyter Notebook

NumPy

Pandas

scikit-learn (KMeans, StandardScaler)

Seaborn

Matplotlib

Installation & Setup

Prerequisites

Python 3.6+

Jupyter Notebook

pip package manager

Installation Steps


Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/gauriaman7/Customer-Segmentation.git

cd Customer-Segmentation

Usage

Open the Jupyter notebooks and run the cells step-by-step to perform data preprocessing, apply scaling, determine the number of clusters (using methods like elbow method), run K-Means clustering, and visualize customer segments.

Features

Data preprocessing and scaling

Determination of optimal cluster count (e.g., elbow method)

K-Means clustering implementation

Visualization of customer segments and cluster characteristics

Business interpretation of each segment
